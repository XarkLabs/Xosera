# Xosera - Xark's Open Source Embedded Retro Adapter

Xosera is a Verilog design currently for iCE40UltraPlus5K FPGA that implements an "Embedded Retro Adapter"
designed primarily for the rosco_m68K series of retro computers (but adaptable to others).  It provides
color video text and graphics generation similar to late 80s 68K era home computers (along with other
capabilities).

This document is meant to provide the low-level reference information to operate it (and ideally
matches the actual Verilog implementation). Please mention it if you spot a discrepency.

## Xosera Reference Information

Xosera has 16 main 16-bit directly accessable bus registers that are used to control its operation.
The even and odd bytes of each 16-bit word are accessed independently (Xosera uses an 8-bit data bus
and "bytesel" signal).  It uses 68000 big-endian convention, so "even" addressed bytes contain the
most significant 8-bits and the "odd" addresses contains the least significant 8-bits of the complete
16-bit value. When writing values, typically the upper 8-bits are saved until the lower 8-bits are written
and then the entire 16-bit value is stored.  For this reason typically you should update the first (even or
high-byte) byte before the second (odd or low-byte) byte or update both with a MOVEP.W write.

Xosera's 128KB of VRAM is organized as 64K x 16-bit words, so a full VRAM address is 16-bits (and an
individual byte is not directly accessible, only 16-bit words). [TODO: nibble masking writes is possible,
but currently not wired up]

In addition to the main registers and VRAM, there is an additional extended register / memory bus that provides
access to many more control registers for system control, video configuration, drawing engines and display
co-processor as well as additional memory regions for tile definitions, color look-up and display coprocessor
instructions.

## Xosera Main Register Details (XM Registers)

**0x0 `XM_XR_DATA` (R/W+) - eXtended Register / eXtended Region Address**
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_XR_ADDR.svg">  
**Extended register or memory address for data accessed via `XM_XR_DATA`**  
Specifies the XR register or address to be accessed via `XM_XR_DATA`.
The upper 2 bits select XR registers or memory region and the lower 12 bits select the register number or
memory word address within the region (see below for details of XR registers and memory).
When `XM_XR_DATA` is written, the register/address specified will be read and made available for reading at `XM_XR_DATA`
(`XM_XR_DATA` needs to be written each time before reading `XM_XR_DATA` or the previously read value will be returned).
After a word is written to `XM_XR_DATA`, the lower 12-bits of `XM_XR_DATA` will be auto-incremented by 1 which
allows writing to contiguous registers or memory by repeatedly writing to `XM_XR_DATA`.  
The register mapping with `XM_XR_DATA` following `XM_XR_DATA` allows for M68K code similar to the following to set an
XR register to an immediate value:  
&emsp;&emsp;`MOVE.L #$rrXXXX,D0`  
&emsp;&emsp;`MOVEP.L D0,XR_ADDR(A1)`

**0x1 `XM_XR_DATA` (R/W+) - eXtended Register / eXtended Region Data**
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_XR_DATA.svg">  
**Read or write extended register or memory addressed by `XM_XR_DATA` register.**  
Allows read/write access to the XR register or memory using address contained in `XM_XR_DATA` register.  
When `XM_XR_DATA` is written, the XR register or address specified will be read will be available for reading at `XM_XR_DATA`
(`XM_XR_DATA` needs to be set each time before reading `XM_XR_DATA` or the previously read value will be returned).  
After a word is written to `XM_XR_DATA`, the lower 12-bits of `XM_XR_DATA` will be auto-incremented by 1 which
allows writing to contiguous XR registers or memory by repeatedly writing to `XM_XR_DATA`.  

**0x2 `XM_RD_INCR` (R/W) - increment value for `XM_RD_ADDR` when `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2` is read from**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_RD_INCR.svg">  
**Read or write twos-complement value added to `XM_RD_ADDR` when `XM_DATA` or `XM_DATA_2` is read from**  
Allows quickly reading Xosera VRAM from `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2` when using a fixed increment.  
Added to `XM_RD_ADDR` when `XM_DATA` or `XM_DATA_2` is read from (twos complement, so value can be negative).  

**0x3 `XM_RD_ADDR` (R/W+) - VRAM read address for `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2`**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_RD_ADDR.svg">  
**Read or write VRAM address that will be read when `XM_DATA` or `XM_DATA_2` is read from.**  
Specifies VRAM address used when reading from VRAM via `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2`.  
When `XM_RD_ADDR` is written (or incremented by `XM_RD_INCR`) the corresponding word in VRAM is read and made
available for reading at `X_DATA` or `XM_DATA_2`.  

**0x4 `XM_WR_INCR` (R/W) - increment value for `XM_WR_ADDR` when `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2` is written to**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_WR_INCR.svg">  
**Read or write twos-complement value added to `XM_WR_ADDR` when `XM_DATA` or `XM_DATA_2` is written to.**  
Allows quickly writing to Xosera VRAM via `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2` when using a fixed increment.  
Added to `XM_WR_ADDR` when `XM_DATA` or `XM_DATA_2` is written to (twos complement, so value can be negative).  

**0x5 `XM_WR_ADDR` (R/W) - VRAM write address for `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2`**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_WR_ADDR.svg">  
**Read or write VRAM address written when `XM_DATA` or `XM_DATA_2` is written to.**  
Specifies VRAM address used when writing to VRAM via `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2`.  

**0x6 `XM_DATA` (R+/W+) - VRAM memory value to read/write at VRAM address `XM_RD_ADDR`/`XM_WR_ADDR`, respectively**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_DATA.svg">  
**Read or write VRAM value from VRAM at `XM_RD_ADDR`/`XM_WR_ADDR` and add `XM_RD_INCR`/`XM_WR_INCR` to `XM_RD_ADDR`/`XM_WR_ADDR`, respectively.**  
When `XM_DATA` is read data from VRAM at `XM_RD_ADDR` is returned and `XM_RD_INCR` is added to `XM_RD_ADDR` and pre-reading the new VRAM address begins.  
When `XM_DATA` is written, begins writing value to VRAM at `XM_WR_ADDR` and `XM_WR_INCR` is added to `XM_WR_ADDR`.  

**0x7 `XM_DATA_2` (R+/W+) - VRAM memory value to read/write at VRAM address `XM_RD_ADDR`/`XM_WR_ADDR`, respectively**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_DATA.svg">  
**Read or write VRAM value from VRAM at `XM_RD_ADDR`/`XM_WR_ADDR` and add `XM_RD_INCR`/`XM_WR_INCR` to `XM_RD_ADDR`/`XM_WR_ADDR`, respectively.**  
When `XM_DATA_2` is read data from VRAM at `XM_RD_ADDR` is returned and `XM_RD_INCR` is added to `XM_RD_ADDR` and pre-reading the new VRAM address begins.  
When `XM_DATA_2` is written, begins writing value to VRAM at `XM_WR_ADDR` and adds `XM_WR_INCR` to `XM_WR_ADDR`.  
NOTE: This register is identical to `XM_DATA` to allow for 32-bit "long" MOVEP.L transfers to/from `XM_DATA` for additional speed (however, it does have its own nibble write mask).  

**0x8 `XM_SYS_CTRL` (R/W+) - draw busy status, reconfigure, interrupt control and write masking control [TODO]**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_SYS_CTRL.svg">  
**Read draw busy, write to reboot FPGA or read/write interrupt control/status and `XM_DATA` nibble write mask.**  
Read:&emsp;[3:0] `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2` nibble write masks, [7] draw busy, [3:0] interrupt enables  
Write:&emsp;[15] reboot FPGA to [14:13] configuration, [11:8] `XM_DATA`/`XM_DATA_2` nibble write masks, [3:0] interrupt mask (1 allows corresponding interrupt source to generate CPU interrupt).

**0x9 `XM_TIMER` (R/W) - 1/10<sup>th</sup> of millisecond timer (0 - 6553.5 ms) / interrupt clear**
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_TIMER.svg">  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_TIMER_W.svg">  
**Read 16-bit timer, increments every 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a millisecond**  
**Write to clear interrupt status**  
Can be used for fairly accurate timing.  When value wraps, internal fractional value is maintined (so as accurate as FPGA PLL clock).  

**0xA `XM_UNUSED_A` (R/W) - unused register 0xA**  
Unused direct register 0xA  

**0xB `XM_UNUSED_B` (R/W) - unused register 0xB**  
Unused direct register 0xB  

**0xC `XM_RW_INCR` (R/W) - increment value for `XM_RW_ADDR` when `XM_RW_DATA`/`XM_RW_DATA_2`is read or written**
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_RW_INCR.svg">  
**Read or write twos-complement value added to`XM_RW_ADDR` when `XM_RW_DATA` or `XM_RW_DATA_2`is read from or written to.**
Allows quickly reading/writing Xosera VRAM from`XM_RW_DATA`/`XM_RW_DATA_2` when using a fixed `XM_RW_ADDR` increment.  
Added to `XM_RW_ADDR` when `XM_RW_DATA` or`XM_RW_DATA_2` is read from (twos complement so value can be negative).  

**0xD `XM_RW_ADDR` (R/W+) - VRAM read/write address for accessed at `XM_RW_DATA`/`XM_RW_DATA_2`**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_RW_ADDR.svg">  
**Read or write VRAM address read when`XM_RW_DATA` or `XM_RW_DATA_2`is read from or written to.**
Specifies VRAM address used when reading or writing from VRAM via`XM_RW_DATA`/`XM_RW_DATA_2`.  
When `XM_RW_ADDR` is written (or incremented by `XM_RW_INCR`) the corresponding word in VRAM is read and made available for reading at `WR_DATA` or `WR_DATA_2`.  
Since this read always happens (even when only intending to write), prefer using RW_ADDR for
reading (but fairly small VRAM access overhead).  

**0xE `XM_RW_DATA` (R+/W+) - VRAM memory value to read/write at VRAM address`XM_RW_ADDR`**  
<img src="./pics/wd_XM_RW_DATA.svg">  
**Read or write VRAM value in VRAM at`XM_RW_ADDR` and add `XM_RW_INCR` to `XM_RW_ADDR`.**  
When`XM_RW_DATA`is read, returns data from VRAM at `XM_RW_ADDR`, adds `XM_RW_INCR` to `XM_RW_ADDR` and begins reading new VRAM value.
When `XM_RW_DATA` is written, begins writing value to VRAM at `XM_RW_ADDR` and adds `XM_RW_INCR` to `XM_RW_ADDR` and begins reading new VRAM value.

To access an XR register or XR memory address, write the XR register number or address to `XM_XR_DATA`, then read or write to `XM_XR_DATA` (note that currently only XR registers can be read, not XR memory).  
Each word written to `XM_XR_DATA` will also automatically increment `XM_XR_DATA` to allows faster consecutive updates (like for color or tile RAM update).  
Note that this is not the case when reading from `XM_XR_DATA`, you _must_ write to `XM_XR_DATA` in order to trigger a read (or previously read value will remain).

TODO: Investigate a way to read color, tile or copper memory (perhaps not during display time)

### Xosera Extended Registers Details (XR Registers)

This XR registers are used to control of most Xosera operation other than CPU VRAM access and a few miscellaneous functions accessed via the main registers.  
To access these registers, write the register address to `XM_XR_DATA` (with bit [15] zero), then read or write register data to `XM_XR_DATA` (and when _writing only_, the low 12-bits of `XM_XR_DATA` will be auto-incremented for each word written).

## Video Synchronized Co-Processor Details

Xosera provides a dedicated video co-processor, synchronized to the pixel clock. The co-processor
(or "copper") can be programmed to perform video register manipulation on a frame-by-frame basis
in sync with the video beam. With careful programming this enables many advanced effects to be
achieved, such as multi-resolution displays and simultaneous display of more colors than would
otherwise be possible.

Interaction with the copper involves two Xosera memory areas:

- XR Register 0x01 - The **`XR_COPP_CTRL`** register
- Xosera XR memory area **`0xA000-0xA7FF`** - The **`XR_COPPER_MEM`** area

In general, programming the copper comprises loading a copper program (or 'copper list') into
the `XR_COPPER_MEM` area, and then setting the starting PC (if necessary) and enable bit in
the `XR_COPP_CTRL` register.

> **Note:** The PC contained in the control register is the _initial_ PC, used to initialize
the copper at the next vertical blanking interval. It is **not** read during a frame, and
cannot be used to perform jumps - see instead the `JMP` instruction.

### Programming the Co-processor

As mentioned, copper programs (aka 'The Copper List') live in XR memory at `0xA000`. This memory
segment is 2K in size, and all copper instructions are 32-bits, meaning there is space for a
maximum of 512 instructions at any one time.

When enabled, the copper will run through as much of the program as time allows within each frame.
At the end of each frame (during the vertical blanking interval) the program is restarted at the
PC contained in the control register.

You should **always** set up a program for the copper before you enable it. Once enabled, it is
always running in sync with the pixel clock. There is no specific 'stop' or 'done' instruction
(though the wait instruction can be used with both X and Y ignored as a "wait for end of frame"
instruction).

Although illegal instructions are ignored, the undefined nature of memory at start up means that
if the copper is enabled without a program being loaded into its memory segment, undefined
behaviour and display corruption may result.

As far as the copper is concerned, all coordinates are in native resolution (i.e. 640x480 or
848x480). They do not account for any pixel doubling or other settings you may have made.

The copper broadly follows the Amiga copper in terms of instructions (though we may add more
as time progresses). There are multiple variants of the MOVE instruction that each move to a
different place (see next section).

### Co-processor Instruction Set

There are four basic copper instructions: `WAIT`, `SKIP`, `MOVE` and `JUMP`. Briefly, their function
is:

| Instruction | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WAIT`      | Wait until the video beam reaches (or exceeds) a specified position          |
| `SKIP`      | Skip the next instruction if the video beam has reached a specified position |
| `MOVE`      | Move immediate data to a target destination                                  |
| `JUMP`      | Change the copper program-counter to the given immediate value               |

Copper instructions take multiple pixels to execute. The timing for each instruction is
detailed below, along with the binary format.

The `MOVE` instruction is actually subdivided into four specific types of move, as detailed
below.

**`WAIT` - [0000 oYYY YYYY YYYY],[oXXX XXXX XXXX FFFF]**

Wait for a given screen position to be reached (or exceeded).

Flags:

- [0] = Ignore vertical position
- [1] = Ignore horizontal position
- [2] = Reserved
- [3] = Reserved

If both horizontal and vertical ignore flags are set, this instruction will wait
indefinitely (until the end of the frame). This can be used as a special "wait for
end of frame" instruction.

**`SKIP` - [0010 oYYY YYYY YYYY],[oXXX XXXX XXXX FFFF]**

Skip the next instruction if a given screen position has been reached.

Flags:

- [0] = Ignore vertical position
- [1] = Ignore horizontal position
- [2] = Reserved
- [3] = Reserved

If both horizontal and vertical ignore flags are set, this instruction will **always**
skip the next instruction. While not especially useful in its own right, this can come
in handy in conjunction with in-place code modification.

**`JMP` - [0100 oAAA AAAA AAAA],[oooo oooo oooo oooo]**

Jump to the given copper RAM address.

**`MOVER` - [1001 FFFF AAAA AAAA],[DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD]**

Move 16-bit data to XR register specified by 8-bit address.

**`MOVEF` - [1010 AAAA AAAA AAAA],[DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD]**

Move 16-bit data to `XR_TILE_MEM` (or 'font') memory.

**`MOVEP` - [1011 oooo AAAA AAAA],[DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD]**

Move 16-bit data to `XR_COLOR_MEM` (or 'palette') memory.

**`MOVEC` - [1100 oAAA AAAA AAAA],[DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD]**

Move 16-bit data to `XR_COPPER_MEM` memory.

Key:

```text
Y - Y position (11 bits)
X - X position (11 bits)
F - Flags
R - Register
A - Address
D - Data
o - Not used / don't care
```

#### Notes on the MOVE variants

With the available `MOVE` variants, the copper can directly MOVE to the following:

- Any Xosera XR register (including the copper control register)
- Xosera font memory
- Xosera color memory
- Xosera copper memory

The copper **cannot** directly MOVE to the following, and this is by design:

- Xosera main registers
- Video RAM
- Sprite RAM (this limitation may be removed in future).

It is also possible to change the copper program that runs on a frame-by-frame basis
(both from copper code and m68k program code) by modifying the copper control register. The copper
supports jumps within the same frame with the JMP instruction.

Because the copper can directly write to it's own memory segment, self-modifying code is supported
(by modifying copper memory from your copper code) and of course m68k program code can modify that
memory at will using the Xosera registers.

> **Note**: When modifying copper code from the m68k, and depending on the nature of your modifications,
you may need to sync with vblank to avoid display artifacts.

### Co-processer Assembler

Co-processor instructions will often be written programatically, or directly (in hex) within
a higher level machine language, for loading into the copper at runtime. The instruction format
has been specifically designed to make it easier to read and write code directly in hexadecimal.

However, you may also find it useful to write copper programs in a slightly higher-level language,
and translate these into machine instructions. For this purpose, a
[customasm](https://github.com/hlorenzi/customasm)-compatible assembler definition is provided
in the `copper/copper_asm` directory. See the `copper.casm` file along with the provided examples
for details of use.

A simple executable ruby script, `bin2c.rb` is also provided in that directory. This is a simple
utility that takes assembled copper binaries and outputs them as a C array (with associated size)
for direct embedding into C code.

### Pritive Renderer

To render a primitive, a sequence of commands must be written to the `XVID_WR_PR_CMD` register. Each command is 16-bit
therefore the MSB must be sent before the LSB. The command will be accepted by the primitive renderer when the LSB is
received. The renderer will draw the primitive after receiving the `PR_EXECUTE` command.

The status can be retrieved by reading the `XVID_WR_PR_CMD` register. The bit 15 of the status is the busy bit.
Before sending an execute command, the user must check if this bit is cleared.

To reduce the number of bus accesses, parameters such as coordinates or color are optional in the sequence of commands. If not sent, the last value of the given parameter received by the primitive renderer will be used.

The primitive renderer only supports 8-bpp mode with 2x H&V scale factors (mode 0x75). Therefore, the
maximum effective resolution is 320x240.

Due to memory constraints, double buffering is only available with 200 lines (or lower). The destination height
must be set to 200 (or lower) in order to clip properly the rendered pixels at the bottom.
